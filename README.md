# Pima-Indians-Diabetes
Investigate a Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset
## Introduction
- Diabetes is one of the deadliest diseases in the world. It is not only a disease but also creator of different kinds of diseases like heart attack, blindness etc. The normal identifying process is that patients need to visit a diagnostic center, consult their doctor, and sit tight for a day or more to get their reports. So, the objective of this project is to identify whether the patient has diabetes or not based on diagnostic measurements.. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
- The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
